## Description

This is a wonderful game to test your Marvel knowledge and see your score at the very end
for how well you did!

- My motivation for this is my love of the Marvel Universe and all the characters and stories behind it.
- I built this to see and collect information on how well others know their Marvel information, and allow others to test themselves
